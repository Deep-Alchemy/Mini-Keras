**NOTE**: We are not affliated with [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team) in any way.
We're making a lightweight library for ML and Deep learning.

## Our principle and Ethics

OUR Principles and Ethics:

- We believe in resources not used, is resources wasted. Hence we have GPU support for people who want speed.
- We believe in lightweight things, and speeding things up for everyone by default, hence we have kept it 
  lightweight, and speeding it up as we go.
- Having an easy to use API is always recommended and better, our API is easy to use, get started, and suits 
  the needs of everyone.
- The code we write, follows several linting rules. We believe clean code is the best.
- Keeping things separate, and different is a good way to manage large things, and we're trying to follow 
  that and make the API understandable for everyone.
- **We believe in all the factors combine and make a beautiful, and a production end product, And We'll be giving our 
  best towards the following things:**
  - Keeping things the best quality
  - Enforcing rules to keep things safe, and clean
  - Being active, and helping out the community.
  - Reaching out, and helping those who need it.

If you're contributing, we hope you follow the contributing guidelines, and our principles. If this is new 
to you, It's gonna be a lot helpful in the future too when working with teams and other people, and increases 
the quality of several factors in many ways.
